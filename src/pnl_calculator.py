"""PnLCalculator: expected P&L engine for calendar-spread market making (Issue #9).

Streaming design — data is consumed one spread transaction at a time, so it
works identically whether the driver iterates a list of daily
``CalendarSpreadData`` or the memory-bounded ``iter_calendar_spread_data``
generator:

    calc = PnLCalculator()
    cost_calc = LeggingCostCalculator()          # Issue #8
    for datum in fetcher.iter_calendar_spread_data(...):
        replay(datum, cost_calc, calc)
    pnl_of_the_period = calc.generate_pnl()

Components:
- ``OrderBook``      — as-of book state lookup for one instrument (for
                       ad-hoc queries and analysis).
- ``replay``         — driver: merges book updates and spread trades of one
                       ``CalendarSpreadData`` into a single time-ordered
                       event stream and walks it once. Book events refresh
                       the cached current state; each trade event gets the
                       legging cost (#8) and is fed to the accumulator with
                       the three cached snapshots.
- ``PnLCalculator``  — stateful accumulator: ``consume`` one transaction at
                       a time, ``generate_pnl`` aggregates at the end.

    Model parameters (set by the user):
      - ``p``: probability of being at the head of the best bid/ask queue at
        any moment. Applied as *expected value*: every historical spread
        trade fills us with weight ``p`` (fill quantity = p x trade size),
        so one pass gives the expected P&L deterministically.
      - ``max_position``: maximum absolute spread position ``m`` we are
        willing to hold. When a fill would push us beyond ``m``, we still
        take the fill (we were resting in the queue) but immediately flatten
        the excess by legging the outrights, paying the #8 legging cost plus
        the aggressive fee on the hedged contracts.
      - ``passive_fee`` / ``aggressive_fee``: $/contract. ``passive_fee`` is
        charged on every passively filled contract (negative = rebate);
        ``aggressive_fee`` is charged per spread contract legged out (use it
        to reflect both outright legs' fees).
      - ``contract_multiplier``: $ per point (ES: 50) — converts point-based
        trade/mark prices into dollars (legging costs from #8 arrive already
        in dollars).

    Side convention (aggressor side of the trade): ``"B"`` = buyer lifted
    the ask, so we (passive) SOLD at the trade price; ``"A"`` = seller hit
    the bid, so we BOUGHT. ``"N"`` (unknown) trades are skipped.

    Accounting is cash-based: fills move cash at the trade price, the
    residual position is marked at the last seen spread mid in
    ``generate_pnl`` — so spread-capture edge and inventory moves are both
    captured without separate bookkeeping.
